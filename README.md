limelight-videos-responsive
===========================

My solution to fitting the limelight player into a responsive site.
The player requires the height & width attributes to be set (in pixels)

So I'm using js to write js tags.

The resize functionality is basically a "nice-to-have". It updates the html as rendered by Limelights' js, and which may of course change, and which differs by platform/browser - not all of which I have access to inspect tools on. But at least the player renders at the correct dimensions initially.
